# Black-Scholes equation and framework

This GitHub repository contains all the work related to my research into the Black-Scholes equation. It is currently a work in progress.

## Completed
- Derived the Black-Scholes equation
- Found a closed form solution using the heat equation
- Built an object that computes European call and put option prices using the closed form solution to the Black-Scholes equation
- Given a strike price, time till expiration and risk-free interest rate, I constructed a heat map displaying call and put option prices for varying spot prices and volatilities
- In addition, I also calculated the profitability of these options given the price of the asset at expiration. This is also displayed using a heat map that has a slider to vary the price at expiration.
- Example profitability heat map when the price of the asset at expiration is 120.32
- Constructed a risk-neutral pricing method of computing European option prices
- Implement this method in Python using Monte Carlo simulations

Will be up and ready soon
